{"prompt":"Text: We are a trio of Empathics who have been able to join the ChimaCloud, giving us new vitality as we transform through the ChimaTEK process. Our images have been uploaded into the cloud, which enables us to access a state of expansive cultural memory, including muscle memory that gives us the vocabulary for movement. An oasis or reflecting pool is positioned in the center, where anyone who is moved to express empathy is welcome to activate the space. ChimaTEK meditators are also expected to appear in this gallery to check in on how this space is functioning and occasionally offer instruction. We wear helmet masks when we meditate in coordination with the ChimaCloud. Each mask was originally carved for women to wear after initiation in Sierra Leone. We then adapted them with symbols from masks in American collections. We excavated the bones you see from a burial site in the woods of upstate New York. They are not human but provide evidence of genetic chimerism, as they contain the DNA from both plant and human organisms. A fungus emanates from the bones and sends spores that circulate through our bodies, slowly mutating our DNA in a unique form of cross-species fertilization. This mixing of human and plant taxonomies has resulted in leaf and petal forms and dot patterns that are visible in our costumes and surroundings. This is a ChimaTEK showroom. You are welcome to sit and partake of the atmosphere that the Empathics have prepared for you. Because several components of the system are still awaiting formal approvals, we are still testing the effects of psychic cleansing and remixing via breathing techniques. However, we are confident that even just this taste of the potential effects will assure you that ChimaTEK is right for all your future self's needs.\n\nContext:\n- Place of the text: CNR Museum\n- Activity: Exhibit, Sharing, Meditating, Testing, Partaking\n\nOutput:\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Capture the moment; Share it on social media; Look for more information; Others END"}

{"prompt":"Text: Authenticity is rarely found in grand gestures. Not in lightning strikes or fireworks in the sky. It is a deep-rooted, gentle stirring: an invitation to be meant to be. It's the clearing away of all that is not true, peeling back the layers until you discover what was there in the beginning. It's allowing yourself to be truly known and loved, as well as really knowing and loving someone else. It's the willingness to stand alone in doing what you believe is right, even when what's right isn't a popular choice. Authenticity can't be copied. It can't be false. It withstands shifting sand. It resists comparison. It defies seeing yourself as who you are less than or who you're not. It's acknowledging the difference between what is fake and what is real. Because when we are real, shabbiness won't matter. Lack will disappear. Falling short will lose its foothold. So your time is now. To welcome in the light that is all your own. To dive deep into the glorious reality of who you are meant to be. Let's not tarry, let's not hesitate-in finding the one life we were born to claim. You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, smarter than you think, and loved more than you'll ever know.\n\nContext:\n- Place of the text: Waco, TX\n- Activity: Shopping\n\nOutput:\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Capture the moment; remember and save for later.
