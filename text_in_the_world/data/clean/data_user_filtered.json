We go to a lot of different theme parks and we take a lot of photos. That wouldn't happen to have the, you know, when you first walk into the park, the, you know, the the big, you know, words, the name of the park there. So I think the most useful thing about the the picture having the name of the park in it is that now, you know, years from now, if we look back at our photos, we'll know which park we were at, especially with six flags, you know, so many of their parks have the same rides or the same theming, you know, not a hundred percent the same. But if you were looking side by side at roller coasters or other particular rides from one six legs to another, you wouldn't necessarily know which park you were at, but having that photo in with all of our other photos from that trip. It'll help to, you know, make sure we know which park we're looking at pictures", "img_path": "/Users/ljhnick/Meta/project_followup/text_in_the_world/data/raw/img/7/Christopher D-15235862-2352188-1598365.jpg"}, {"text": "Welcome to CrossFit NOBULL - The Fittest on Earth.

So if I were to use that photo, I would probably use it kinda advertise this water bottle in some way to kinda show that this water bottle stands out from the rest and really just emphasize its usefulness as one that helps you kinda stay up to date with your hydration and make sure that you are staying hydrated.

I like the fact that it is promoting health and wellness from a company and a brand that I trust. What would I do with the photo, I would probably more than likely show my friends because it's also a new product with them being antibacterial wipes. Just probably being able to show my friends like something new that the company came out with that I found that was cute compact, something that they could probably use and keep, like, on their desk or on, you know, their table or somewhere in the car or something. So just finding new ways to use things making sure that it's something that they are interested in. So that's also how I would gauge interest. And that's kind of what I would use it for.", "img_path": "/Users/ljhnick/Meta/project_followup/text_in_the_world/data/raw/img/8/Tiffany S-15236165-2352261-1675283.jpg"}, {"text": "Sweet Dog EXCENTE XG BUTTER Fresh POTATO BITI", "places": ["kitchen"], "activities": ["display"], "actions": ["share"], "categories": [" Share it on social media."], "raw_text": "Sweet Dog  中  EXCENTE  S  XG  BUTTER  better  Fresh  POTATO  BITI", "description": "The picture that I uploaded was of my pioneer woman display that I have in the kitchen.

I took that photo. It was informational poster thing. I was at a coffee shop and I saw it on their their, like, board, and I was getting ready to just settle down.

So it's mostly just to capture all the information quickly and easily and figured since I check my photos and my phone kind of frequently that I would see it.
